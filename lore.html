        <h2 id="shattering">The Shattering and the Fall of the Ancient Ones</h2>
        <p><em>Excerpt from the journal of Sehlora Mirinth, Archivist of the First Sun</em></p>

—

<div class="lore-entry">

  <p><strong>There was a time when the world moved in harmony.</strong></p>

  <p>Before it cracked. Before the light dimmed. Before we forgot the names of our gods.</p>

  <p>I was young when the Ancient Ones still walked among us — not as kings or rulers, but as shepherds of wonder. I remember the Everdawn fields in spring, when the flowered grain shimmered beneath golden sunfire, and glowing beetles sang between the stalks. We laughed. We danced.</p>

  <p>The Ancient Ones didn’t create the world, they guided it. They didn’t shape stone and blood. They shaped values. They sang to rivers and shifted their paths. They whispered to mountains and calmed their trembling hearts.They sang to rivers and turned their course. Whispered to mountains and calmed their trembling hearts.</p>

  <p>Each brought something to us, their minds and powers vast. Iss-Hadal calmed volcanoes with his bare hands. Lei-Sun brought life back to dying trees. Wateirov conjured illusions that showed us distant lands, and entertained us with joyful tales of adventure and discovery.</p>

  <p>We mortals were always flawed — squabbling over borders, taking more than we needed, fearing what we didn’t understand. But they didn’t rule us. They walked beside us. And in their light, we grew. Cultures blossomed, wild and complex. Beautiful in their imperfection.</p>

  <p><strong>Then the star fell.</strong></p>

  <p>No omens. No warnings Just a streak of cold fire across a violet dawn. When it struck the eastern ridges, the world fell silent. A gray haze rolled in. We called it the <em>Caliginous Midnight</em>.</p>

  <p>The ground split. Mountains folded. Cities crumbled. From the ruins came the Oterim — creatures of chaos, born of something deeper, older, darker. They consumed bodies and souls alike. I watched from the temple balcony, helpless, as they tore through city after city, breaking the world we knew.</p>

  <p><strong>And then... The Ancient Ones fought back.</strong></p>

  <p>Guardians and saviors, mighty in their wrath against the storm that had come. They came to protect — as those who could not, would not, abandon what they loved.</p>

  <p>Mortals stood with them. Soldiers, mages, and farmers wielding nothing but resolve. They held bridges. Lit pyres. Bought seconds with their lives. Formed rings around their gods, shielding them with blood and fire so they could think, plan, <em>breathe.</em><p>

  <p>And for a time… it worked.</p>
  
  <strong>Orunyel</strong>, Weaver of Fate, unwound the threads of time, turning deaths into second chances.<br>
  <strong>Kaelmor Sea-Binder</strong> raised lakes into the sky, smashing them down upon armies of shadow.<br>
  <strong>Rikhas the Quiet</strong>, god of shelter, erased entire legions from memory, banished to the folds within thoughts.</p>

  <p>The resistance grew. Plans formed, routes were carved for retreat. The tide slowed, and we had hope.</p>

  <p>But hope… hope is a soft thing. Fragile between the teeth of devouring darkness.</p>

  <p><strong>One by one, they fell.</strong></p>

  <p>Some died with roars that cracked the stars. Others gave themselves to bind a future they would never see. And some simply vanished — no cry, no farewell. Only silence. And the sound of us… running. Falling. Dying.</p>

  <p>Entire civilizations were lost. The <strong>Ra Shemau</strong>, gone beneath shifting sands. The quartz-blooded people of <strong>Thal’Ren</strong>, reduced to ash. Art. Knowledge. Entire peoples — erased, like chalk beneath rain.</p>

  <p>Those of us who remained scattered. Some vanished into the deep forests, others took to the high cliffs, the broken coasts, the hollowed bones of old cities — each chasing rumors of safety, of shelter, of anything that might hold against the dark.</p>

  <p>Many of us came here, to the valley that still stood. The <strong>Czemhaza wa Kanti</strong> — the Mystical Academy — opened its gates wide. They welcomed and sheltered all the peoples and species of broken nations. A place that once stood aloof from the world became a refuge for the weary, the wounded, and those still fighting to survive.</p>

  <p>The great masters of the Academy, after accepting all they could without risking more delay, cast an impenetrable barrier to the outside world. In doing so, they gave their lives, creating a haven — a final reprieve from the horrors of the last few decades.</p>

  <p>And it was here, with trembling hands and voices hoarse from mourning, we built what we could.</p>

  <p><strong>Tonwe Khael’Voreen Et</strong> — <em>Shelter for the Last Songs</em>.</p>

  <p>I don’t know what comes next.<br>
  But I remember what came before.<br>
  <strong>This is what we lost. This is who we are.</strong></p>

  <p><em>And I write it down, so you remember too.</em></p>

  <hr>

  <p><em>The Shattering – History of Khael’Voreen</em><br>
  <em>Written 56 years after the founding of the city</em><br>

      <div class="codex-section">
  <h2 id="regions">The Regions Beyond the Walls</h2>
   <p>Though most who speak of Khael’Voreen focus on its walls and wonders, the city sits within a vast, living valley shaped by its surrounding lands. To the east, west, north, and south stretch four major regions, all contained within the ancient barrier that shields the valley from the outside world.</p>

  <h3>The Eternal Forest – East</h3>

  <p>A sacred expanse of ancient life, the Eternal Forest is home to trees that tower above the canopy and a landscape pulsing with old magic. It is inhabited by primal spirits, elusive predators, and ancient tribes. The elven kin dwell here — long-lived beings whose connection to the land predates even the Academy’s founding.</p>

  <p>They now share the forest with the <strong>Cha’Quakka</strong>, an enigmatic order devoted to balance and the protection of the wild. Deep within the forest lies the domain of the <strong>Spirit Mother</strong>, a powerful presence believed to be bound to the diversity and vitality of the land itself.</p>

  <h3>The Kor Lodrum Mountains – Northwest</h3>

  <p>To the northwest, the land rises into the jagged range of the <strong>Kor Lodrum Mountains</strong> — a realm of stone, steam, and subterranean industry. Inside its hollow peaks lies a city carved into the rock, where dwarves and goblins live in pragmatic tension, forging steel and shaping arcane technologies.</p>

  <p>The mountain’s deep halls serve as both workshop and sanctuary, producing much of the arcane machinery and durable infrastructure that supports life in the city below. Many of Khael’Voreen’s greatest mechanical and magical innovations trace their origins back to these tunnels.</p>

  <h3>The Southern Farmlands & Inland Sea</h3>

  <p>South of the city, the valley opens into rolling farmland, vineyards, and wide terraced fields. This is the breadbasket of the valley — a region overseen by druidic stewards and agricultural guilds. Planting, harvesting, and irrigation are coordinated in cycles aligned with seasonal rituals and magical patterns. The food produced here sustains much of the city’s population.</p>

  <p>Beyond the farmlands lies the <strong>Great Inland Sea</strong>, a massive brackish body of water bordered by stone harbors and coastal settlements. Some of these settlements are partially submerged, built in partnership with aquatic species. Trade and fishing are common in shallow waters, but few venture into the depths.</p>

  <p>Mariners tell stories of shifting currents, glowing structures glimpsed beneath the waves, and haunting music that rises when the winds fall still. Expeditions to chart the sea floor have returned incomplete — or not at all.</p>

  <h3>The Ancient Gate – North</h3>

  <p>The <strong>Ancient Gate</strong>, constructed by both mortal and divine hands, stands as the only known entrance to the valley. It lies roughly 500 feet beyond the inner edge of the barrier and has remained sealed for over four hundred years.</p>

  <p>The gate is under constant guard. While it remains physically unchanged, there are reports of strange occurrences among the sentries — unplaceable whispers, unfamiliar languages, and recurring dreams with shared imagery. No one has passed through it since the Shattering.</p>

  <p>Though no official expeditions have crossed the barrier, sightings have been recorded from afar: figures moving through the tree lines, large beasts on broken plains, and dragons silhouetted against distant skies.</p>

  <p><em>Something is out there. But what, we cannot say.</em></p>

<div class="codex-section">
  <h2 id="heroes">The Heroes Who Shaped the City</h2>
  <p>While Council, tradition, and infrastructure maintain Khael’Voreen, its soul was forged in the acts of a few — individuals whose deeds shaped the lives of the many. Their legacies are sung in taverns, inscribed in the Academy’s vaults, and honored at the Assembly square.</p>

  <p><strong>Caryk Stoneheart</strong> is among the most revered. A champion said to have shoulders like a mountain, Caryk led an elite force known as the Red Legion during the twilight of the Shattering. With the passes collapsing and tides of void horrors advancing on the valley, Caryk and his warriors held the northern route for four days and nights. They used illusions, misdirection, and brutal frontline tactics to delay the enemy, buying time for thousands upon thousands of refugees. Caryk was a High Paladin of the god Lornazelud — the light of divine justice. Upon his death, it is said Ancient Lornazelud emerged from the heaves to carry his soul to the beyond herself.</p>

  <p><strong>Airelen of the Veil</strong>, the Whisper of Stillness, was a high elf enchanter and shadow-walker. During the War of the Shattering, she vanished from the public eye, but whispers spoke of a figure walking battlefields unseen, silencing enemy commanders and turning entire legions upon themselves with whispered commands and perfect illusions. She was the Council's invisible hand, and her very presence was said to still the air. In the final years of the war, she orchestrated the defense of many great cities without ever raising her voice. When the protective barrier was sealed, she was last seen walking into the Eternal Forest, carrying a scroll sealed with ten runes and a single crimson feather..</p>

  <p><strong>The Five Heads of Czemhaza </strong> remain nameless, their statues encased in a warded ring at the center of the valley. These five were among the greatest mages the world has known — each one a master of a different arcane school, each once a head of the Academy. It was they who came up with the plan the protect the valley with a mystical barrier. Knowing their transient mortality could not sustain it long, they used a mythic enchantment to petrify their bodies, their essence (and the barrier) held in stasis for eternity.</p>

  <p><strong>Gruntharc, the Iron Commander</strong>, is green-skinned orc in his early fifties. He is Khael’Voreen’s highest military authority and its most formidable warrior. Despite his age, his body shows no signs of slowing, and his name is legend in the battle arenas. His duels against spellcasters and other formidable martial combatants have made him an icon of strength. Guards and soldiers under his command wear his sigil proudly, as he's known as much for his keen tactical mind as his powerful aura.</p>

  <p><strong>Torren Sunstrike</strong>, the Grand Magus, nicknamed "Wolf-eyes", is the city’s foremost arcane mind. A human of brown-silver hair and sharp blue eyes, Torren has mastered many of the mystical arts. He was one of the key architects behind the Vanguard’s formation and creator of the talisman that now allows travel beyond the barrier. His voice carries weight in all things magical, and his spells have pierced veils that many believed unbreakable. He has publicly denounced the Council on several occasions, accusing them of politcal strategems and greed instead of focusing on the well-being of the City.</p>

  <p><strong>Kuranna Vellhart</strong>, the Commander of the Northern Watch, is an Aasimar that was born under a rare celestial alignment. Raised within the hallowed halls of Khael'Voreen's grand cathedral, Kuranna serves as an advisor to the Council on matters of spirituality and ethics. She also mentors young clerics and paladins, guiding them in their divine callings. While she is gentle and nurturing, she also possesses a fierce determination when protecting the innocent. Her laughter is said to be as refreshing as a cool breeze, and her wrath, though rarely seen, is likened to a fierce tempest. She is often found standing amidst storms, unscathed and serene. </p>

  <p>Whether through sacrifice, vigilance, or silent determination, their stories remain the mortar between the stones, the steady heartbeat of the City and its peoples.</p>

      <div class="codex-section">
        <h2 id="council">The Council of Khael’Voreen</h2>
        <p>Beneath the gleaming spires of the Citadel and nestled within the city’s great chambers, the Council of Khael’Voreen is tasked with preserving the legacy of all the cultures in the valley. Each sitting Council member represents one of the city’s 9 major districts, even the Eternal Forest and the halls of Kor Lodrum have representatives. While a few are beloved figures who regularly walk among their people, most are only seen during public decrees and celebrations.

        <p>Supporting them is a layered system known as the Circle of Rule. City Lords maintain order within the districts, responsible for civilian life, trade, and stability. They oversee the Guilds — powerful organizations that each manage the lifeblood of their district, from infrastructure to innovation to rations for the citizens. Above them, Ambassadors and Clerks operate between districts, coordinating legislation and managing diplomacy between factions and representatives.

        <p>Then there are the Elders — once Council members themselves, they have stepped away from public duties to pursue studies, political manuevering, or long-term projects. Though they no longer have direct power of legistlation, many still hold sway behind closed doors. Some whisper that the Elders control more than any sitting official, and that their influence in shaping the city’s course never truly ends.

        <p>Notably, the Vanguard — the chosen few sent beyond the barrier — report not to the Council directly, but to two figures: the Grand Magus and the Iron Commander. While the Council selected the Vanguard’s members and endorsed the project, their day-to-day oversight is more detached… at least, for now.</p>

 <div class="codex-section">
  <h2 id="magic">Magic Without the Divine</h2>
  <p>In the centuries since the Ancient Ones vanished, magic has not disappeared — but it has changed. Divine spellcasters still heal wounds, shield allies, and smite with holy power. Yet their connection to higher forces is now shrouded in uncertainty. Clerics no longer hear the voices of their gods, and paladins uphold oaths with no reply. Their power remains, but its source is unclear.</p>
  
   <p>Some believe these blessings are echoes — the last whispers of celestial beings long gone. Others insist they stem from within: willpower, commitment, or faith made manifest. Druids, especially those trained deep within the Eternal Forest, still have communion with the Spirit Mother, while others tap into natural forces that have no need for worship. For many, divine connection is not gone, but is distant and unintelligible.</p>

  <p>The arcane, by contrast, thrives through study and structure. At the heart of Khael’Voreen stands the great Academy, where mages pursue knowledge across all known disciplines: evocation, illusion, divination, transmutation, and more. It is the safest hub for those who seek to understand magic in a world that is filled with so many questions.</p>

  <p>Whether your power comes from ancient rites, forgotten relics, or the strength of belief, know this — in Khael’Voreen, magic is still alive. It has evolved to embrace the silence. Ask your GM how your spellcasting class might interact with these mysteries as you create your character.</p>

<div class="codex-section">
  <h2 id="districts">The Districts of the Last Bastion</h2>
  <p>
    Khael’Voreen is a sprawling city with 9 districts, each a fragment of the world that was, preserved within the walls. Viewed from above, the city forms a great ring around the Citadel, with streets spiraling outward like a sunburst, touching the lives of over 5 million souls.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the heart lies the <strong>Citadel District</strong>, home to the towering magical Academy known formally as <em>Czemhaza wa Kanti</em>. It is here that spells are refined, artifacts studied, and magical theory passed down through generations.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <strong>Hammer District</strong> is an echo of the Kor Lodrum mines — a place of smoke, flame, and metal. Here, smiths, alchemists, and artificers shape wonders in stone and metal. To the east lies the <strong>Emerald Belt</strong>, a haven for druids, herbalists, and beast-tamers who dwell close to nature and cultivate the city's connection with the Eternal Forest.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <strong>Watchgate</strong> lines the northern wall, where guards keep a watchful eye on the ramparts. It also serves as both fortress and a training ground to the militant forces of the City. To the south stretches the <strong>Hearthlands</strong>, a district of farmland terraces and colorful markets — a cultural heart where food, music, and history intermingle.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <strong>Shadow Sunward</strong> is a radiant district of columns, pyramidal rooftops, and carved obelisks. Originally built in granite by desert-born peoples, its culture is steeped in honor, reverence, and ancestral rites. Across the city, the <strong>Nephyrfold Heights</strong> rise in elegant layers — a place of orange lantern trees, sweeping roofs, and philosophies that shape sword and spirit alike.
  </p>

  <p>
    Lastly, the <strong>Quiet Belt</strong> forms the liminal districts of the city. A blend of forgotten alleys, odd workshops, and forgotten ruins, most citizens consider it uneventful. But those with connections to the undergound know it holds secrets and mysteries... And more.

  <h2 id="vanguard">The Purpose of the Vanguard</h2>
  <p>
    Forty years ago, the Council unveiled a new initiative — a declaration of intent, a way to inspire hope and curiosity, paving the way to a brighter future. The Vanguard was to be the first sanctioned expedition beyond the barrier since its creation, a group entrusted with the tremendous task of venturing into the forgotten world and bring back answers.
  </p>

  <p>
    To the public, the Vanguard are hailed as heroes — a symbol of resilience and rebirth, chosen from among the city’s most gifted and courageous. The city itself is dedicated to providing resources not given to many citizens, and excitement stirs in the hearts for what's waiting to be discovered. Murals have been painted, ballads composed. For a people who have lived behind enchanted barriers for generations, the Vanguard represents a whole city's curiosity and sense of adventure.
  </p>

  <p>
    Their formation is a process both rigorous and deliberate. Applicants are tested not only on skill, but intuition, resolve, and how they function as a group. Once chosen, the party receives their talisman, a singular artifact called the <em>Al'Karamin</em>. This allows passage back and forth through the barrier, and must be recharged every 8 days in the Academy.
  </p>

  <p>
    The city eagerly awaits for the applicants to be chosen as the Quincentennial of Khael'Voreen approaches, and the identity of the first recruits are to be announced!
