        <h2>The Shattering and the Fall of the Ancient Ones</h2>
        <p><em>As recorded by Sehlora Mirinth, Archivist of the First Sun</em></p>

—

</p>There was a time when the world breathed in harmony.

Before it cracked. Before the light dimmed and we all forgot the name of our own gods.

I was young when the Ancient Ones still walked among us, not as kings or tyrants, but as shepherds of wonder. I remember the scent of the Everdawn fields in spring, where flowered grain shimmered beneath golden sunfire and glowing beetles sung between the stalks. We used to laugh, and sing, and dance. That was the world the Ancient Ones nurtured — not created, but guided. They did not shape stone and blood, but values and connectedness. They sang to rivers and they changed their course. They whispered to mountains and calmed their trembling hearts.

Each of them brought something. Not all were gods in the way you might think — not almighty, not infallible. But they were becaons. Powerful. Vast. Iss-Hadal would walk barefoot into the heart of a volcano and coax it into silence. Londwei would place her hand to the bark of an ailing tree and draw light back into its leaves. Wateirov would make us laugh, his illusions showing us the beauty of distant lands. 

We mortals were flawed. We squabbled over borders, harvested for selfish reasons, feared each other for our skin, our horns, our wings. But the Ancient Ones never ruled us. They guided us. And through their presence, we grew — cultures blossomed like wildflowers, tangled and diverse, beautiful in their own imperfect colours.

Then came the star.

It fell without warning — no prophecy, no sign. A cold fire that did not burn, streaking across a violet dawn. The day it struck the eastern ridges, everything went dark. We could not see more than a few feet away, a misty haze blanketing the world as all held their breath in fear. We called it the Caliginous Midnight. Every temple bell rang at once, though no hand touched them.

The world groaned. Mountains folded in upon themselves. Waters rose and consumed. Storms that had no sky shattered entire cities in moments. And in the wake of the tremors, they came — the Hollow-Born. Creatures not of flesh or spirit, but of some terrible being. Wrongness made real. They tore through our lands like hunger incarnate, and even the gods faltered in their wake. I watched from the balcony of the First Sun temple as the sky itself bled. I saw the screaming masses, refugees from broken homelands, fleeing in waves with eyes of horror.

Then the Ancient Ones fought back. Gods and demons clashed across battlefields, a hellfire of chaos and destruction. For a time, they held, and I believed like a fool that they would not lose. But faith is a soft thing when between the fangs of a dark entity. One by one, they were overcome. Some few were struck down, others sacrificed themselves. And the rest simply… vanished.

No farewells. No promises. Just silence.

In the decades that followed, entire civilizations were lost. The Ra Shemau desert people gone. The quartz-blooded people of the Thal’Ren river, turned to ashes. Millenias worth of learning, crafting, art... forgotten. Names and cultures, lost. Entire species like they never existed.

We — the survivors — gathered beneath the one place that held strong. The massive valley where the Mystical Academy (Czemhaza wa Kanti) offered sanctuary to all creatures and beings. And there, with trembling hands and voices hoarse from grief, we built our final shelter. Tonwe Khael’Voreen Et - <p><em> Shelter for the Last Songs</em></p>

It cuts deep into my soul, to speak of what was lost. But I remember.

And I write it down, so that you remember too.</p>
